## Lesson 2

1. Create race emulator
Need to create a program that will fill the arrays with random numbers.
It is also necessary to determine when and in which array the sum of the elements will be more than 100.
Fill in with numbers from 2 to 10

If the sum of elements is exceeded by 5 (105 or more), the game starts over

2. Create roulettes*

Need to create a program that will run 3 roulettes.
-Each of the roulette wheels must choose a random word from input argument and save.
-The game ends when more than 10 same words are accumulated in one of the roulettes.
-It's best to pass a book as an argument.
-The random number that will indicate the index of a word in the book must be in the range from 0 to the index of the last word in the book.
